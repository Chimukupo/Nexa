Interface Design Specification: Nexa

Version: 1.0
Design Philosophy: "Apple Minimalist" – Clean, Neutral, Data-First.
Target Output: Pixel-perfect implementation using Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui.

1. Design Principles

Reduction: If a border, shadow, or label isn't critical, remove it. Use whitespace to separate content instead of lines.

Softness: Heavy use of rounded corners (rounded-2xl or rounded-3xl) and super-soft, diffused shadows to create depth without clutter.

Data as Art: Charts and numbers are the heroes. They should be large, legible, and use distinct accent colors against a neutral background.

2. Color System (Tailwind Variables)

Based on the "Nexa" branding and Blue primary buttons.

Primary (Nexa Blue): #007AFF (Apple Blue) or #2563EB (Tailwind Blue-600). Used for Primary Buttons and Active States.
